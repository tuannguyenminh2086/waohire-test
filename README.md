Dear interviewer,

I have completed the task and deployed to https://waohire-test.vercel.app/

![Screenshot](https://waohire-test.vercel.app/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

I have used Vue 3, Pinia, and Tailwind CSS for this task. In detail:

- Vue 3: I have used Vue 3 for this task.
- Pinia: I have used Pinia for state management.
- Tailwind CSS: I have used Tailwind CSS for styling.

The component names 'Users' inside the 'src/components/users' directory are as follows:

- users/index.vue
- users/list.vue
- users/filter.vue
- users/sort.vue
- users/orderby.vue

The store name is 'users-store' and it is located in 'src/stores/users.ts'. inside 'src/stores/users.ts' file, I have used Pinia for state management. The store has the following properties:

- users: array of users
- filteredUsers: array of filtered users
- loading: boolean
- error: string
- sortBy: string
- sortDirection: string
- searchQuery: string

The 'users/index.vue' file is the main component that displays the list of users. It uses the 'users-store' to get the list of users and display them in a table. The 'users/list.vue' component is used to display the list of users in a table. The 'users/filter.vue' component is used to filter the list of users by name, email, and company. The 'users/sort.vue' component is used to sort the list of users by name, email, and company. The 'users/orderby.vue' component is used to order the list of users by name, email, and company.

Please check the deployed site.

Thank you.
